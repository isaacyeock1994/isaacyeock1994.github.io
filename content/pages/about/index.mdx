Hi!

I am Isaac, at the moment I am running [Bleads.io](https://bleads.io), a B2B e-mail marketing agency.

My skill set is an intersection of Finance, Technology and Marketing.

I studied Economics and Finance at the University of London and I am currently a Master of Finance student in SUSS.

My work experience spans across technology consulting, predictive analytics and systems integration.

Bleads.io - Co-founder: Built a lead generation and cold email outreach service to help agency businesses
engage with start-ups that have just raised funding in their seed round and early series. Interacting with CEOs
and Founders on a daily basis, I have learned how key stakeholders and decision-makers think and what they
look for when strategizing for their company's growth. Weekly reporting is also made to summarize the
progress and performance of their campaigns (they love this).

Blipps.io - Co-founder: Built a book referral site for Kindle and Kobo readers. It allows you to upload and
share your favorite highlights on social media. Users can also have discussions on their latest reads. This
experience has allowed me to learn the ins and outs of launching a platform, from frontend to backend
development, to building and connecting databases and hosting.

Accenture - Consultant: I was a technology consultant gathering requirements from clients and translating
business requirements to technical specifics for our software engineers. In this role, I was able to learn how
to speak to stakeholders of different business units and departments. This was where I learned to
communicate effectively and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
